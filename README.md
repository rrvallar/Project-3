## Description

This is a movie app that lets users create an account and store their favorite movies.  The user can login or signup, then navigate to the Home tab where they have the abiity to swipe through a stack of movie posters, with swiping left to remove the movie and swiping right to add to the user's library.

## Installation

Download the files or clone the repo into a local directory. Run 'npm init -y' then 'npm i' to install the depencdencies.  'cd' into both 'client' and 'server' and run 'npm i' to install both dependencies.  

## Start

To see the project in development mode, 'cd' into 'server' and enter 'npm run watch' then 'cd' into 'client' directory and enter 'npm start.' The page will automatically navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. It will reload with every saved change.

To build the project into a single folder/production mode, enter 'npm run build.'  This bundles everything together and optimizes performance so the files can be deployed.
